## Context

The Kubernetes backend was [introduced to Tinkerbell](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/tree/28ad00608c176871a57d5a5519d9a3f4b9d1cf98/proposals/0026) and has subsequently become the only supported backend. The proposal outlined how the Kubernetes backend would integrate with the various Tinkerbell services but opted to maintain existing Workflow execution paradgims.

The [v1alpha2 API](https://github.com/tinkerbell/roadmap/blob/main/design/20230222_tinkerbell_crd_refactor.md) simplifies the Kubernetes API by removing unnecessary functionality such as Tasks (a feature for multi-worker workflows). However, the changes to the API that have seen entire features dropped have never been reflected in the code making it difficult to maintain.

## Goals/Non-goals

**Goals**
* Simplify the Tink Agent - Tink Server communication to what's necessary.
* Define the components involved in Workflow execution and their responsibilities.
* Provide clear behavioral expectations in failure cases.

**Non-goals**
* Introduce new functionality beyond that specified in the v1alpha2 API unless necessary for the new Workflow execution proposal.

## Existing Solution

Tinkerbell defines 3 core components involved with Workflow execution: Tink Worker, Tink Server and Tink Controller. Tink Worker runs on the target device and executes Workflow actions reporting the result of actions to Tink Server. On startup, Tink Worker connects to Tink Server providing a unique identifier that Tink Server uses to retrieve Workflows. As Tink Server receives the result of executing actions from Tink Worker, it updates the Workflow resource.

Tink Controller is responsible for preparing Workflows using Templates. When a user submits Hardware, Workflow and Template resources to the system, Tink Controller renders the Template storing the output on the Workflow status field. Tink Controller bears no other responsibility.

Tink Worker communicates with Tink Server over gRPC. There are a handful of obsolete RPCs that are unimplemented in Tink Server since the transition to the Kubernetes backend (see Appendix A for existing protobuf).

## Proposal

### Summary

The components used in Workflow execution will remain similar to the existing solution. Tink Agent (renamed from Tink Worker) will run on the device to be provisioned and is responsible for executing Workflows. Tink Server will instruct Tink Agent to run and cancel Workflows, and will update Workflow status based on Workflow execution Events published by Tink Agent. Tink Controller will prepare Workflows for execution and monitor them for erroneous states taking any necessary remedial action. The architecture draws similarities with the [Scheduler-Agent-Supervisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor) pattern.

### Workflow States

<p align="center">
  <img alt="[State Transitions]" src="./images/230728_tinkerbell_workflow_execution/state.png" />
</p>

#### Why do we need the Scheduled state?

The Scheduled state is an intermediary state that indicates a Workflow has been dispatched to Tink Agent but hasn't started. Tink Controller will monitor Workflows in a Scheduled state and transition them to Failed if a timeout trips.

Workflows may also be rejected by Tink Agent explicitly for cases such as a double dispatch. In the event a Workflow is rejected it will transition back to Pending. Workflow rejection is discussed later.

#### Why do we need the Cancelling state?

The Cancelling state separates Workflows we intend to cancel from those that have been cancelled. This allows Tink Server to issue a cancellation instruction to Tink Agent, and for Tink Agent to indicate successful cancellation. The explicitness of this sequence is useful because:
* It provides explicit indication that a Running Workflow has stopped making it clear that Tink Agent is available to run a subsequent Workflow.
* It makes clear to operators the state of the Workflow and why Tink Agent isn't executing a subsequent Workflow.

### Executing Workflows

Tink Server will continue to expose a gRPC API. The protobuf will be simplified to remove superfluous APIs and data structures. Tink Agent will connect to Tink Server to create a long lived command stream. When Tink Server identifies a runnable Workflow for a connected Tink Agent it will dispatch the Workflow on the command stream. Workflows are dispatched in the order they are created. As Tink Agent executes Workflow Actions it will publish events to Tink Server.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/230728_tinkerbell_workflow_execution/executing-a-workflow.png" />
</p>

#### Service protobuf

The Workflow Service exposes 2 APIs, 1 for establishing a command stream and 1 for publishing Workflow execution events. The full protobuf can be found in Appendix B.

```protobuf
// WorkflowService is responsible for retrieving workflows to be executed by the agent and
// publishing events as a workflow executes.
service WorkflowService {
  // GetWorkflows creates a stream that will receive workflows intended for the agent identified
  // by the GetWorkflowsRequest.agent_id.
  rpc GetWorkflows(GetWorkflowsRequest) returns (stream GetWorkflowsResponse) {}

  // PublishEvent publishes a workflow event.
  rpc PublishEvent(PublishEventRequest) returns (PublishEventResponse) {}
}
```

#### Workflow Events

| Event               | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ActionStarted`     | The action has begun executing                                                                  |
| `ActionSucceeded`   | The action has completed successfully                                                           |
| `ActionFailed`      | The action failed to complete. Appropriate failure reason and message will accompany the event  |
| `WorkflowRejected`  | Tink Agent has explicitly rejected the request to run the Workflow |

### Cancelling a Workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/230728_tinkerbell_workflow_execution/cancelling-workflow.png" />
</p>

Users cancel Workflows by deleting them. In response to the delete request, Tink Controller will transition the Workflow to Cancelling or Canceled (in the case of a Pending state).

It is necessary for the Tink Controller to transition the Workflow as opposed to Tink Server because the Workflow beacuse Tink Server may not be monitoring the Workflow.

When Tink Controller transitions a Workflow to Cancelling, Tink Server will receive the update and dispatch a cancel command to Tink Agent.

To prevent a Workflow from being garbage collected Tink Controller will populate a [finalizer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) when it performs the initial preparation of the Workflow. Tink Controller will remove the finalizer when the Workflow transitions to an end state.

If the Workflow stays in a Cancelling state for too long (for example due to a Tink Agent crash) Tink Controller will force the Workflow into a Canceled state and populate a failure Reason and Message so the user is still aware an issue occurred.

If a user wants a Workflow to persist after deletion it is their responsibility to populate a [finalizer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) to ensure it isn't garbage collected.

### Handling a rejected Workflow

When a Workflow is dispatched to Tink Agent it transitions to a Scheduled state. If Tink Agent rejects a Workflow, because its already running a Workflow, it will be transitioned back to Pending by Tink Server. The Workflow will not be scheduled again until a configurable time period has elapsed. The time period will grow with each retry attempt up-to a maximum.

## Failure Modes

### Supervising Workflows

In addition to preparing Workflows, Tink Controller supervises Workflow execution. The core concerns Tink Controller supervises include:
1. Ensuring Scheduled Workflows transition to a Running state within a finite time period. When the period has elapsed Tink Cotnroller will transition the Workflow to a Failed state.
2. Ensuring Cancelling Workflows transition to a Canceled state within a finite time period. When the period has elapsed Tink Controller will transition the Workflow to a Canceled state with appropriate failure reason and message.
3. Ensuring Running Workflows complete within the configured timeout.
4. Ensuring individual Workflow Actions execute within the configured timeout.

### What happens if 2 Tink Agents connect to Tink Server with the same identifier?

When Tink Agents connect to Tink Server they will present uniquely identifying information. If 2 Tink Agent instances present the same identifying information the behavior is undefined.

### What happens if 2 Workflows are dispatched to Tink Agent (double dispatch)?

Tink Server is responsible for controlling the flow of Workflows to Tink Agent. If Tink Server didn't have a record for an executing Workflow, or if an executing Workflows state was misrepresented on the Workflow resource, Tink Server may perform a double Workflow dispatch.

If Tink Worker receives a second Workflow while currently executing a Workflow it will dispatch a Workflow rejection event for the second Workflow.

On receiving the Workflow rejection event Tink Server will transition the Workflow to a Pending state. The Workflow will not be scheduled again until a configurable period has elapsed.
